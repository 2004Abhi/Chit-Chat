# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

We expect all members of our community to adhere to the following standards of behavior:

### Positive Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language that fosters collaboration and respect.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints, experiences, and backgrounds.
* Offering and gracefully accepting constructive criticism, feedback, and suggestions.
* Focusing on what is best for the community as a whole and working towards common goals.

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, unwelcome sexual attention or advances, or other forms of harassment.
* Trolling, insulting, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment, including bullying, intimidation, or stalking.
* Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
* ngaging in behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

As project maintainers, we are responsible for creating and maintaining a safe and respectful community environment. We will:

### Clarify Standards

* Clearly communicate the standards of acceptable behavior to all community members.
* Provide guidance and support to individuals who are unsure about whether their behavior aligns with these standards.

### Enforcement

* Take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
* Evaluate each situation individually and consider the context, severity, and impact of the behavior.
* Exercise discretion in determining the most appropriate course of action, which may include correction, warning, temporary ban, or permanent ban.

### Correction

* Offer constructive feedback to individuals who have engaged in behavior that violates the Code of Conduct.
* Encourage understanding and accountability by providing guidance on how to modify behavior in alignment with community standards.

### Warning

* Issue formal warnings to individuals who continue to engage in behavior that violates the Code of Conduct after receiving corrective feedback.
* Clearly communicate the reasons for the warning and the expected changes in behavior.

### Temporary Ban

* Temporarily restrict access to community resources and spaces for individuals who persistently violate the Code of Conduct or engage in egregious behavior.
* Specify the duration of the ban and the conditions for reinstatement, which may include a formal apology or completion of educational resources on appropriate conduct.

### Permanent Ban

* Permanently revoke access to community resources and spaces for individuals who demonstrate a pattern of serious or repeated violations of the Code of Conduct.
* Provide clear justification for the permanent ban and communicate the decision to the individual in writing.

## Enforcement Guidelines
